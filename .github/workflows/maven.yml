# Define the events that trigger this workflow.

  push:
    branches:
      - master  # Trigger on pushes to the 'main' branch
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master  # Trigger on pull requests targeting the 'main' branch

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that run sequentially or in parallel.
jobs:
  build:
    # The type of runner machine to use.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # The steps that make up the job.
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE.
      # This is the first step in every workflow to get access to your code.
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Sets up a Java JDK environment.
      # It ensures the correct Java version is available for the build.
      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '17'

          cache: 'maven'

      # Step 3: This step is automatically handled by the previous one.
      # The 'cache' parameter in 'actions/setup-java' caches Maven dependencies.

      # Step 4: Run the Maven command to build and package the application.
      # 'clean install' will compile the code, run tests, and package it into a JAR.
